        <h2>Introduction to Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Technology refers to the collection of tools, processes, and systems that humans create to solve problems, improve efficiency, 
            and make life more convenient. From the invention of the wheel to the rise of artificial intelligence, technology has been a 
            driving force behind human progress.
        </p>
        
        <h2>History of Technology</h2>
        <p>
            The history of technology spans thousands of years, starting with simple stone tools used by early humans. Key milestones include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prehistoric Era:</strong> Discovery of fire, development of stone tools, and basic farming equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Ancient Civilizations:</strong> Invention of the wheel, writing systems, and irrigation methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Ages:</strong> Mechanical clocks, windmills, and printing press revolutionizing communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Revolution:</strong> Steam engines, electricity, and mass production transforming industries.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Era:</strong> Computers, the internet, and space exploration shaping the global economy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Technology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Information Technology (IT):</strong> Deals with computing, data storage, and communication systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Technology:</strong> Includes diagnostic machines, robotic surgery, and advanced pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering Technology:</strong> Covers mechanical, civil, and electrical innovations.</li>
            <li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong> Genetic engineering, agriculture improvement, and biofuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Technology:</strong> Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Impact of Technology on Society</h2>
        <p>
            Technology impacts almost every aspect of our lives. It has improved healthcare, enabled global communication, and 
            increased productivity. However, it also presents challenges such as job automation, digital addiction, and privacy concerns.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Positive Impacts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster communication through email, social media, and instant messaging.</li>
            <li>Access to vast information via the internet.</li>
            <li>Medical advancements saving millions of lives.</li>
            <li>Automation reducing human labor in dangerous jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Negative Impacts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cybersecurity threats and data breaches.</li>
            <li>Job displacement due to automation.</li>
            <li>Social isolation from excessive screen time.</li>
            <li>Environmental harm from e-waste and industrial pollution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future of Technology</h2>
        <p>
            The future of technology holds exciting possibilities. Artificial intelligence may become more human-like, quantum computing could 
            revolutionize problem-solving, and space exploration might expand humanity’s presence beyond Earth. However, with great power 
            comes great responsibility, and ethical considerations will be crucial in shaping the path forward.
