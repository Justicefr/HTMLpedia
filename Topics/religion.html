      <h2>Introduction to Religion</h2>
      <p>
        Religion is a system of beliefs, values, and practices that connects
        humanity with the divine or sacred. Across history, religion has played
        a central role in shaping cultures, laws, traditions, and human
        relationships. It often provides meaning, moral guidance, and a sense of
        community to billions of people worldwide.

      <p>
        Religion has shaped human history in profound ways—guiding ethics,
        inspiring art, influencing laws, and fostering unity. At the same time,
        religious differences have sometimes caused conflicts and divisions.

      <h2>Religion and the Search for Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, religion addresses humanity’s deepest questions: Why are we
        here? What is our purpose? What happens after death? While the answers
        differ across faiths, religion often points to a reality greater than
        ourselves and a call to live with hope, humility, and love.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses
        his own soul?" – Mark 8:36 (NKJV)
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Salvation of the Soul (Christian Perspective)</h2>
      <p>
        In Christianity, salvation is God’s gift to humanity through the
        sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that all have sinned and
        fall short of God’s glory (<em>Romans 3:23</em>), but through faith in
        Jesus, forgiveness and eternal life are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John 3:16</strong> declares:
        <em
          >"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
          whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting
          life."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>The path to salvation is simple yet profound:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Acknowledge your sins and need for God’s forgiveness.</li>
        <li>Believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>Confess Him as Lord and commit to following Him.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Romans 10:9</strong> says:
        <em
          >"If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your
          heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Christ, every soul can find peace, purpose, and eternal life
        with God.
