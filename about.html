        <h2>Welcome to HTMLpedia</h2>
        <p>
          HTMLpedia is a collaborative project created by students to explore
          the world of web development while sharing knowledge on different
          topics. Our website acts like a mini-encyclopedia, bringing together
          interesting facts and information about animals, technology, space,
          history, food, and sports.

        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of HTMLpedia is to practice building structured websites
          using HTML and to present useful, fun, and educational content. By
          working together, we combined our creativity and technical skills to
          design a space where learning meets collaboration.

        <h2>The Team Behind HTMLpedia</h2>

       <p> HTMLpedia was built as a collaborative effort. Each team member
  contributed their own topic page, from animals to technology, to make
  the site diverse and engaging. This teamwork allowed us to learn not
  only coding, but also how to collaborate effectively on a shared
  project. The images above showcase our team members, each of whom
  played a vital role in shaping HTMLpedia. By combining our different
  strengths, creativity, and ideas, we were able to create a project
  that reflects true teamwork and shared learning. </p>
