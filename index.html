      <h2>About HTMLpedia</h2>
      <p>
        HTMLpedia is a collaborative project built entirely with HTML to help us
        practice
        <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> collaboration. Each
        member of our team created a unique topic page and contributed to shared
        pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is simple, but it represents the teamwork, planning, and
        version control skills we’ve learned together.

        <li><a href="topics/tech.html">Technology</a> - by Justice</li>
        <p>
          The great illusionist of our time. It convinces us that we’re in
          control while secretly running the world on code we don’t fully
          understand. From smartphones that know us better than our parents,<br />
          to AI that writes poetry while plotting to replace our jobs,
          technology is both humanity’s proudest creation and biggest gamble.
          Think of it as magic, except the wand has a charging port.

        <li><a href="topics/history.html">History</a> - by Darlington</li>
        <p>
          The longest group chat in human existence, except you can’t mute it.
          It’s full of receipts, grudges, and people making the same mistakes in
          different outfits. History explains where we came from,<br />
          but also why we shouldn’t trust anyone who says, “This time, it’ll be
          different.” It’s humanity’s instruction manual, the problem is, nobody
          reads it until something goes wrong.

        <li><a href="Topics/">Space</a> - by Victor</li>
        <p>
          The universe’s ultimate flex. Billions of galaxies, countless stars,
          and a suspicious silence that makes us wonder if aliens have us
          blocked. Humanity keeps peeking into it with telescopes,<br />
          building rockets, and sending golden records, as if to say, “Please
          like and subscribe to Earth.” Space reminds us how tiny we are. PS:
          GOD CREATED THE SPACE AND ALL IT ENTAILS!

        <li><a href="topics/animals.html">Animals</a> - by Cynthia</li>
        <p>
          Nature’s original influencers. Before humans invented drama, animals
          were already out there roaring, chirping, and showing off survival
          hacks on the daily. They’re comedians, engineers, and <br />
          athletes without even trying, ants build cities, dolphins gossip, and
          cats act like landlords. JUST like mine.

        <li><a href="topics/food.html">Food</a> - by Peculiar</li>
        <p>
          The original technology. Before Wi-Fi, there was “Why fry?” Food is
          proof that humans won’t settle for survival.We want flavor, culture,
          and Instagram-worthy plating. From fire-roasted chicken<br />
          to organic grown turkey, it shows our eternal obsession with turning
          calories into cuisine. It’s also the only art form you can admire,
          digest, and regret at 2 a.m. all in one sitting. FOOD is GOOD
        </p>

        <li><a href="topics/sports.html">Sports</a> - by Zion</li>
        <p>
          Society’s legal way of fighting without calling it war. Whether it’s
          kicking balls, swinging bats, or throwing punches in slow motion for
          replays, sport takes raw chaos and sells it as discipline<br />
          It unites nations, breaks hearts, and makes billionaires out of people
          who can run faster than average. At its core, it’s proof that humans
          will do anything for glory, sweat, and OVERPRICED jerseys.

        <li><a href="/topics/religion.html">Religion</a> - by Chiugo</li>
        <p>
          The oldest software humanity ever installed. Different versions,
          countless updates, devoted communities, and always a debate over the
          user manual. It’s shaped civilizations, sparked wars, inspired<br />
          art, and given people a reason to wake up, forgive, or fear. Whether
          you see it as divine truth or NOT, CHRIST IS KING!
